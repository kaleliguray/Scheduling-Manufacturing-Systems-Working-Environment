# üìö Scheduling Manufacturing Systems üìö

* <p>First of all, this repository is about the lecture that was given during my master's education at Munich Technical University.</p>

* <p>The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the Scheduling Manufacturing Systems Lecture, utilizing Python as the primary programming language along with the Gurobi Optimizer for mathematical optimization. Its purpose is to study and analyze manufacturing systems efficiently, being a resource for the lecture.</p>

* <p>By integrating the powerful optimization capabilities of Gurobi with Python, learners can explore various scheduling techniques and gain insights into optimizing manufacturing processes. Through a collection of Python scripts, libraries, and documentation, users can delve deeper into the complexities of manufacturing systems, and produce a solution to tackle complex challenges in production scheduling by using both Python and Gurobi Optimizer to.</p>

* <p>Overall, Whether for academic learning or practical application, this repository aims to empower users with the examples and explanations they need to cover and be a resource for scheduling manufacturing systems.</p>

## Python

### Introduction

* Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

* Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library that provides tools and modules for various tasks, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing.

* One of Python's key features is its indentation-based syntax, which enforces code readability and reduces the need for excessive punctuation. This feature makes Python code visually consistent and easier to understand.

* Python's versatility and ease of use have contributed to its widespread adoption across industries and domains, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

### String, Print, Type And Comment

<ul>
  <li>Character collections known as strings are used to depict a character sequence.</li>
  <li>Quote marks, either single or double, are used to represent strings.</li>
  <li>The print() method in Python is used to print text, such as a string or number, to the screen.</li>
  <li>The type function can be used to display an object's type.</li>
  <li>In Python, comments are denoted by the hash symbol (#) and allow programmers to annotate their code for clarity or documentation. They are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution, making them useful for providing context or explanations within the code.</li>
</ul>

~~~
# Define a string variable
my_string = "Hello, world!"

# Print the string
print(my_string)

# Check the type of the variable
print(type(my_string))
~~~
___
~~~
Hello, world!
<class 'str'>
~~~

### Integers And Floats

<ul>
  <li>Python has two built-in methods for representing numbers: integer and float.</li>
  <li>Decimal numbers are represented by floating points.</li>
</ul>

~~~
# Integer example
my_integer = 10
print("Integer example:", my_integer)

# Float example
my_float = 3.14
print("Float example:", my_float)
~~~
___
~~~
Integer example: 10
Float example: 3.14
~~~
